Create a detailed AutoCAD layout for a Smart Drip Irrigation System prototype for a residential/urban plot of 50 m² (10m x 5m) in Gaza. The design must be scientific, precise, and clearly labeled with all dimensions, flow rates, pipe diameters, and component specifications. Include the following elements:

1. Water Source:
   - Small reservoir/tank or direct connection to treated water source.
   - Label with water capacity if tank.

2. Pump:
   - Ensure pump can provide at least 2.0 bar at 0.183 L/s (660 L/h).
   - Label flow rate and pressure.

3. Filtration System:
   - Mesh or disc filter to prevent emitter clogging.
   - Indicate inlet and outlet connections.

4. Mainline:
   - Pipe type: PVC/PE
   - Diameter: 25 mm (3/4 inch)
   - Route from pump/filter to the lateral lines.
   - Show flow direction.

5. Control Valve:
   - Solenoid valve for automatic irrigation.
   - Indicate valve location on mainline.

6. Lateral Lines:
   - 10 lateral lines, each 10m long, spaced 0.5m apart.
   - Pipe diameter: 16 mm (1/2 inch)
   - Connect to mainline.
   - Label each lateral line with flow rate (~0.018 L/s).

7. Emitters:
   - 33 emitters per lateral line, spaced 0.3m apart.
   - Flow per emitter: 2 L/h
   - Show connection to lateral lines.
   - Indicate precise placement.

8. Smart Controller:
   - Connects to soil moisture sensors and weather sensor.
   - Indicate controller location.
   - Draw sensor placement across the plot (e.g., 2-3 sensors).

9. Elevations and Pressure:
   - Show total dynamic head calculation (TDH ~1.6 bar).
   - Indicate flow direction and pressure at key points.

10. Labels and Dimensions:
    - Include all pipe diameters, lengths, emitter spacing, and flow rates.
    - Show overall plot dimensions (10m x 5m).
    - Include clear symbols for pump, filter, valve, controller, and emitters.

11. Aesthetic and Clarity:
    - Use standard CAD symbols for irrigation components.
    - Ensure all lines are straight, angles precise, and layout easy to read.
    - Include a title block with project name, date, designer, and scale.

Output: Ready-to-use CAD drawing with all layers properly organized (water source, mainline, laterals, emitters, control devices).
